# COMP2001-CW2
2nd Coursework Repository for the COMP2001 Module

The SQL Queries provided here are the scripts shown below the chosen table as I did not save the original creation queries, but the provided scripts are the same just with extra stuff, for further evidence of the database behind the Microservice implementation simply look to the database.

Added the version 17 driver since the version 18 one wasn't working.

IMPORTANT: I have the 17 driver in the dockerfile but it still has an issue. If it does not run, I followed the exact instructions and the microservice runs just fine if not through the dockerfile.
